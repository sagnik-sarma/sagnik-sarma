- 👋 Top of the `${timeOfDay}` to you! I'm called Sagnik, at least that's what my birth certificate says.
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Cocktails, and reading Philosophy. Usually, I like to go from tinkering with a JS framework to reading Dostoevsky, both having equal amounts of existential dread.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to make sense of Python, Docker, and the Cloud. It sounds vague, but adds to the mystery. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...anything. I love collaborating and contributing to ideas; it's such a cathartic experience to be able to build something. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email -> sagnik.sarma@gmail.com | Social -> @sagnik_sarma | Discord -> TheUmbrellaMan #7128
